# Intro To Coding

These [Processing](https://processing.org/) sketches are part of a [six-hour workshop](https://www.sandiego-art.org/upcoming/introtocoding) taught on 21 & 23 February 2018 by @blockwooddev and @jasonalderman at Front Gallery in San Ysidro, as part of [SDAI](http://www.sandiego-art.org/)'s A>M>T Festival.

## Day 1

00. Setup (20 min.)
01. println() — this is called a function, explain parts (also explain Processing IDE, console, and errors) (15 min.)
02. draw shapes! — introduce size(), the coordinate system, and show shape functions in documentation (20 min.)
03. loop — introduce variables (remember string?) and use variables to draw many shapes to the screen (20 min.)
04. follow mouse — intro setup() and draw() and mouseX/mouseY
05. if/else — make something happen when the mouseX/mouseY is in a certain part of window

## Day 2
06. arrays and ArrayList — make a trail of shapes (in x and y arrays), then use 2D array instead
07. image() —draw images
08. pixels[] — get pixel data and represent it with differently colored/sized shapes
09. advanced: do the same with webcam video
<span style="opacity: .35;">10. advanced: translate and rotate and push/pop (make inverse kinematics tentacles?)</span>
11. Classes (and tabs in Processing)
12. Using libraries - import statement and the processing.sound library
13. Play a sound file - change playback speed with mouse movement
14. Adapt sketch 5 from day 1 to play a different sound file when mouse crosses the threshold boundaries you set ...how do you get it to play only once each time?
15. Make equalizer from a sound file using FFT
16. Play with synthesis?

## Future explorations?
* Make interactive visualization involving sound input or output
* Advanced: envelope stuff?
